Points in the 3rd and 4th quadrant will have a negative Polar angle (between -π and π)
make angles between 0 and 2π instead? (T or F):
T
Decimal places to round to:
6
Give each point increasingly greater full rotations [gives a more spiral-like polar equasion] (T or F):
F
List points below in (x, y [, full rotations]) form [anything outide of parenthesis will be ignored]:
(-10, 7) (-8, 6) (-5, -5) (6, -4) (-4, 6)
